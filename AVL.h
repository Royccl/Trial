 * @brief AVL tree class

 *        you have already completed in the DSA-BST assignment.
 *        However, it is up to you how you implement this class, as long as 
 *        the interface works as expected in test.cpp
 *        If you choose not to inherit from BST, you can remove all the 
 *        inheritance code, e.g., `: public BST<T>` from the class definition, 
 *        `virtual`/`override` modifiers from the inherited methods, etc.
 * @tparam T Type of data to be stored in the tree
